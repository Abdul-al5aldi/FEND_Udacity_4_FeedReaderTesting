# Feed Reader Testing Project

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where we come in.


## Why This Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether working in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## Implemented Tests That Should Pass

The required tests for the project (`RSS Feed` testing, `RSS Feed` properties, menu default state, and menu hiding/showing) are all provided and are comprehensive enough to adequately test the functionality.


## Running the Application

Application can be run by simply opening `index.html` file.
